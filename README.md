# beverleyy.github.io

This is my personal website and portfolio, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Please see the not-maintained `html_old` branch if the (deprecated) pure static HTML version of the site is of interest.

## Design

### Colors

In an effort to create and maintain a more ~professional~ image, the brat green scheme has been replaced by sharp blues and reds from the [USPS x Pantone color palette](https://www.pantone.com/usps250).

| Color           | Hex code                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Jet Black       | ![#2d2c2f](https://placehold.co/16x16/2d2c2f/2d2c2f.png) `#2d2c2f` |
| USPS Blue       | ![#004c90](https://placehold.co/16x16/004c90/004c90.png) `#004c90` |
| Carrier Red     | ![#7a0015](https://placehold.co/16x16/7a0015/7a0015.png) `#7a0015` |
| Airmail Red     | ![#ee202d](https://placehold.co/16x16/ee202d/ee202d.png) `#ee202d` |
| Parchment White | ![#fffdea](https://placehold.co/16x16/fffdea/fffdea.png) `#fffdea` |

### Typography

A readable modern geometric typeface is chosen for the body font and paired with a splash of retro aviation.

### Layout and features

* `Isotope.js` was used as the base to generate a flexible template grid that can be filled in with various projects and items. 
* Filtering takes care of the different sections of a traditional website, allowing for an all-encompassing single-page layout.
* Google sheets integration for news and publication list
* Light and dark modes
* Fully responsive
