# beverleyy.github.io

This is my personal website and portfolio, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Please see the not-maintained `html_old` branch if the (deprecated) pure static HTML version of the site is of interest.

## Design

### Colors

The base palette consists of warm neutral Pantone colors. A splash of brat green is added to give some Personality and Character to the website.

### Typography

A readable modern geometric typeface is chosen for the body font and paired with a splash of funky fluid accents.

* Filtering takes care of the different sections of a traditional website, allowing for an all-encompassing single-page layout.
* Google sheets integration for news and publication list
* Light and dark modes
* Fully responsive
