Hi! I'm <strong>Beverley</strong>, a second-year Stanford Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student from Singapore. I am interested in high-performance computing, aerospace engineering, and numerical methods for turbulent flows. I aspire to <em>develop computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes</em> that can produce high-fidelity flow visualizations on consumer computers. I enjoy writing code and building/destroying computers.
