BloomScroller is a non-intrusive browser extension for Twitter that combines doomscrolling using AI, gamification, and psychology. My teammates Yu Hann, Alexis, Wei Bin, and I built this for [MindfulHacks 2021](https://mindfulhacks.devpost.com/) where we finished as champion team.

I was responsible for most of the front-end code, scraping the tweets from Twitter for the extension to process, and injecting the warnings and popup into Twitter.
