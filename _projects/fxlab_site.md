As part of the [FX Lab](https://fxlab.stanford.edu), I worked with my labmate James to redesign the lab website. I added the Stanford brand bar and footer to the al-folio Jekyll theme, redesigned many of the content pages, and wrote a new template for the research page.

Jekyll reduces the code maintenance required for future website maintainers and I wrote detailed and extensive documentation to make it easy for others to add/modify pages. Additionally, I built a scraper to scrape Matthias' Google Scholar for new papers to be added to the bibliography to generate the publications page using Jekyll Scholar.
