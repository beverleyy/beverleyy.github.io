#### Description

* Investigate possibility to reduce wind tunnel usage in aerodynamic analysis and determine aerodynamic coefficients from dynamic system response.
* Develop least-square regression models combined with usage of MATLAB system identification toolbox to determine stability and aerodynamic coefficients.
